# Exercises

### 1. 
*Create a synchSM to blink three LEDs connected to PB0, PB1, and PB2 in sequence, 1 second each. Implement that synchSM in C using the method defined in class. In addition to demoing your program, you will need to show that your code adheres entirely to the method with no variations.*
  
### 2. 
*Create a simple light game that requires pressing a button on PA0 while the middle of three LEDs on PB0, PB1, and PB2 is lit. The LEDs light for 300 ms each in sequence. When the button is pressed, the currently lit LED stays lit. Pressing the button again restarts the game.*
