# Exercises

# Prelab
*Wire accordingly* 
*input: PA[0] connected to potentiometer*
*output: PB[7:0] connected to LEDs*
         *PD[1:0] connected to LEDs*

# 1. 
*Make sure your breadboard is wired according to the prelab. The potentiometer is used to adjust the voltage supplied to the microcontroller for ADC . Design a system that reads the 10-bit ADC result from the ADC register, and displays the result on a bank of 10 LEDs.*

# 2. 
*Modify the above example so the three LEDs light for 300 ms, while PB3's LED still blinks 1 second on and 1 second off.*

# 3. 
*To the previous exercise's implementation, connect your speaker's red wire to PB4 and black wire to ground. Add a third task that toggles PB4 on for 2 ms and off for 2 ms as long as a switch on PA2 is in the on position.*
